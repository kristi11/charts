## Charts

This is a simple project showing data through. You can use this to visualize data on your admin panel or wherever you might need to.
This particular project uses [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) and laravel [livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/)

## Getting Started
Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` inside your project root and fill the database information. Open the console and `cd` into your project root directory.

* Run `composer install` to install necesary files
* Run `php artisan key:generate` to generate a unique app key.
* Run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`.This will migrate all the necessary database tables
* Run `php artisan serve` to boot up the app.

#### Any outside help or ideas are more than welcome.
